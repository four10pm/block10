<b> Paulina's personal website </b>
This is a website about me. 
It has 3 tabs: home (my basic info, an intro statement, photos of my dogs); about (work history, education history, volunteer work, skills, and hobbies); and portfolio (examples of completed work). It also includes a contact form to submit an email message, with a successful submission page. 
It includes HTML, CSS, and JS files.
